The main challenge here is laying out the cards in a three column design and make it responsive according to the user screen.

## My solution
&&&&&&&&&&&

&&&&&&&&&&&
I started building with the three main cards on top of each other, considering the mobile design first. Once everything is settled for the mobile screens, I then added media queries
and reorganized the cards horizontally, forming a one big card the contains the three smaller cards as its columns. From there, it was just a matter of scaling the size the main card
according to the size of the screen.
